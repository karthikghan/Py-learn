--> Objects encapsulate state
--> Objects have some functionality attached to it
--> Methods are functions attaced to objects
--> Python is a dynamic language
--> Python allows you to re-allocate variables to a different datatype
--> Dont use camel case for variable names
--> Integers/Strings/Floats are immutable..i.e, You cant change a string , you can only create a new string...
--> Values in lists are mutable, meaning you can change the value of a variable without re-assigning it
--> Dictionaries are immutable 
--> Tuples cant be modified 
--> Dictionaries: Order is not gauranteed unlike a list
--> There is some special package for making a dictionary items retrieve in order
--> You can use int or float also for keys in a dictionary...but cant use a list as a key for a dict item like below:
  other = { [1,2]: 'test'} --> not correct

--> is operator is different from == operator
eg: 1 == 1.0 return true
    1 is 1.0 returns false
  check memory allocation id(1) , id(1.0)

--> ## Namespace object type

    import package

 	for eg: import argparse (package)

 	            it will have constructor function called class, say, ArgumentParser() [it can even take some arguments]

 	                class will have methods [which are just functions attached to the class] that can accept argument, say, add_argument

 	      usage:    import argparse
 	                
 	                parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
 	                parser.add_argument('filename', help='the file to read')

 	                args = parser.parse_args()
